# University Recommendation System

## Challenge Summary

Suggest top 5 Higher Education universities to a student by matching student's with the universities' profile. Student Profile: Current Education level, Field of study, Chosen research, entrepreneurship, and financial status. University Profile: location (climate, cost of living), the field, overall ranking, fees and tuition, other factors.

- **Context / Impact:** Saciva is an app for Students, especially international students to help through their higher education journey and choosing a university is the first step and often research on academics and tuition and over look factors such as climate, opportunities after in their field, cost of living, safety, etc. before they take admission.

- **Suggested Approach:** The student's profile can be vectorized to find the nearest data (unsupervised learning) to suggest the 5 most suitable universities to the student.

Project README file: This is essential for all AI Studio Challenge Projects. Ensure it includes project overview, objectives, methodology, results, and potential next steps (more details on this on the next page of this module).

Sample dataset(s): Include sample datasets to help users test the project effectively. Ensure that any datasets used are properly licensed and that users understand how to access the data.

Jupyter or Colab notebooks: Provide example notebooks demonstrating how to implement your project, including any relevant code snippets, visualizations, and explanations of the logic behind your models.

Installation instructions: Include step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project locally, install dependencies, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Consider using a requirements.txt file for Python dependencies.

Complete project documentation: Ensure that your project is well-documented, including user guides, API documentation, and code comments to help others replicate your work. This is vital for both usability and maintainability.

License file: Include a LICENSE file to clarify the terms under which your project can be used and shared.

Project Title and Description
Purpose: Introduce your project with more than just a brief summary. This section should provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the project's purpose, methods, and outcomes.
Suggested Content:
Project Overview, Objectives, and Goals:
Include a clear description of the project, its main objectives, and what you aimed to achieve. Explain the problem your project addresses and why it's important.
Methodology:
Provide details on the methods and approaches you used, such as the data collection and preprocessing steps, the models and algorithms applied, and any relevant tools or libraries.
Results and Key Findings:
Summarize your main results, including performance metrics like accuracy, F1 score, or AUC. Highlight any key insights or discoveries made during the project.
Visualizations:
Include visual representations of your results, such as training/validation curves, confusion matrices, or example predictions. This helps convey the effectiveness and accuracy of your approach.
Potential Next Steps:
Outline what could be done to improve or extend the project. This could include additional experiments, fine-tuning, or deployment plans. Discuss future directions or applications of your work.
